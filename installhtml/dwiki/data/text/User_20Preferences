Please fill out '''[[GetText(Name)]]''', '''[[GetText(Password)]]''', '''[[GetText(Password repeat)]]''' and '''[[GetText(Email)]]'''.

If you click on '''[[GetText(Create Profile)]]''', a user profile will be created for you and you will be logged in immediately.

= Logging in =
If want to re-login, just use '''[[GetText(Name)]]''' and '''[[GetText(Password)]]''' and click on '''[[GetText(Login)]]'''.

If you '''forgot your password''', attempt to log in via the login box in the upper right hand corner of the screen and you will be given further instruction.

= Changing settings =
'''[[GetText(Save)]]''' updates your profile (stored on the wiki server).

= Logging out =
'''[[GetText(Logout)]]''' clears the cookie created at login.

= The Cookie =
/!\ The "ID", shown in the response page, gets saved as a cookie in your browser for the system to temporarily recognize you. It will expire next midnight - except if you choose '''[[GetText(Remember login information forever)]]''' (after being logged in), then the cookie won't expire.
