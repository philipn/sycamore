The Rules of a Marching Band Battle:
 * Each band will play a song when their turn comes up.
 * No band may play a song that has already been played.
 * When a band no longer wishes to play, or runs out of songs, they play their fight song and leave.
 * Last band standing wins.
 * An agreement may be made to end a battle if both sides wish to leave. However, the ["Aggie Band"] will play their fight song last, no matter what.
