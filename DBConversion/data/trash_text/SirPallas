[http://pallas.telperion.info I] am a knight of the ["Order of Telperion"] and probably the coolest knight on campus. I've never done ''anything'' with the ["Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion"] -- they probably don't even exist! I do hang out in ["Kemper Hall"] a lot, and have something to do with ["Team Aggie Spirit"].


Once in awhile I do things with the ["Newman Center"] or ["Alpha Gamma Omega"]. Only ["ASUCD" the gods] know why.

I am definitely a member of ["Well Known Secret"].
