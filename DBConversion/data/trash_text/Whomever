Formed in 2000 by Darren Reid aka "DARyL" and ["EricWecker" Eric Wecker] aka "The Wiz", whomever is about questioning the assumptions people live by (in a dope hip hop style, of course). When the group formed, DARyL was down in Santa Barbara playing with his band "El Jefe" and Wiz was enjoying the ["Hip-hop scene" Davis hip-hop scene]. Things have changed, but whomever is still at it. Both DARyL and Wiz are in a new local hip hop band, ["Davis Joint Unified"], so you'll be seeing them around.
