These are the core issues of the ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] ["Slate"], whose members are running for ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"].

A more in-depth discussion of the issues below is at ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform"].

[[TableOfContents]]

= Openness in Student Government =
  Bringing Student Government Downstairs:: By moving ["Senate"] meetings into the ["Coffee House"] and holding Office Hours on the ["Quad"], we move student government from the Ivory Tower of the third floor down to the people it serves.

  Student Government Documents Available Online:: ["ASUCD"] should save paper and promote open government by putting ''all'' of its [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/gov/docs/ documents online], making student government both environmentally and socially conscious.

  Improve the ASUCD Commissions:: We want to streamline ineffective commissions and committees, and give them the power they need to get their work done.  We will also support the ["Gender and Sexuality Commission"], and give them a new focus on student health.

  More Electoral Power for Students:: We will support a ["Countback"] Amendment in Senate elections, so that vacant seats will be filled by those who elected the original candidate.  We want to expand the Senate to 18 seats, so that ["Choice Voting"] can select candidates from more underrepresented groups. 



= Emphasize Good Business Practices =
  Stop Wasteful Spending:: We will speak for fiscal responsibility in the Senate, as they repeatedly spend your money on special interests and themselves. They have bought a fire truck that doesn't put out fires, a superfluous vinyl sign for self-promotion, and take ASUCD retreats in cabins at Lake Tahoe.  These cost $7,080 in student money -- money that should be used for students or returned to students.

  Two-thirds Vote to Increase Student Fees:: If elected, we will support a constitutional amendment requiring that two-thirds of voters in a campus election must approve fee increases, as special interest voting blocks have dominated elections which increased your student government fees to the highest in the U.C. system.

  Audits of ASUCD Units:: We will look at all ASUCD units to see if they are working efficiently and serving the whole community.  Units that serve too few people take funds that could be used in more effective units which serve everyone.

  Support Worker Benefits:: Since ASUCD didn't budget enough money to units, some units are cutting positions back to 19 hours a week.  Not only does this deprive people of benefits and inefficiencies in hiring, it forces students to look for more jobs to support themselves.  We seek to restore these benefits.



= Services for All Students =
  More Unitrans or Tipsy Taxi Service in Late Night:: Having late night lines could prevent drunk driving and serve our student population better, so we will investigate which service could better provide this.

  Staplers in the Computer Labs:: It makes sense that staplers should be where students will use them, so we have already written a bill to buy staplers for the ["Computer Labs"] on campus.

  Making Campus Computing Better:: This slate will seek to put in a remote printing station, so that you can print your documents from a home computer for from the wireless network.  We also want a new server for Geckomail, as the email slowdown is annoying to a great number of students.

  Sanitary Seat Covers in the Library Restrooms:: We believe that all restrooms on campus need these simple sanitary devices, and we will urge the campus and/or ASUCD to provide them.

  Campus Entertainment:: Entertainment events need to be expanded, from movie premieres to Davis Music Scene concerts.  We want to provide the Old Firehouse as a venue for music events, now that the Band-Uh! has moved out.

  Promoting Campus Safety:: We will promote pre-existing programs to increase campus safety, including self-defense classes at the ["Women's Center"] and the ["Campus Safety Escort Service"].

  Textbook Website:: Since book prices are so high, we plan to create a website listing textbooks needed in every class with ISBN numbers.  This will allow students to shop around for better textbook prices before the quarter starts.
