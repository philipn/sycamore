DavisWiki shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or delete any Content that it reasonably considers to violate the terms above or be otherwise illegal. DavisWiki, in its sole and absolute discretion, may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or judicial or governmental mandate or as reasonably determined useful by DavisWiki to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of DavisWiki's users and the public. DavisWiki does not control the Content posted to the DavisWiki Site and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. Under no circumstances will DavisWiki be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via DavisWiki Site.

...okay, failing that, here are my notes (from jw):
-----
 * This is strictly a content and use disclaimer.  Privacy and other issues are separate, but this is a core point to start from.  Basically:  "The views and opinions expressed on DavisWiki are those of it's users and do not necessarily represent those of this station, it's staff or advertisers".  (Did that one at signoff for years). 

 * DavisWiki as an entity needs to be defined.  You had mentioned creating a non-profit.  Normally I deal with companies either incorporated or individuals dba a business.  You'll have to add a paragraph at the beginning saying what comprises ("DavisWiki") at the top.

 * I removed several points.  There is no clause for outages and closure of the site since the one I had was full of references to fees and there are no fees for this site.  

 * The key clause I removed was the Indemnification clause.  It will have to be rewritten, but is generic enough to be available as a template on a legal site.
