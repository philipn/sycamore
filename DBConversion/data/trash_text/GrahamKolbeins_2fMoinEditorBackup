This page is a list of things Davis sorely lacks.  Businesses will, of course, take note of our suggestions.

= Restaurants =

== Old G Street Menu ==
 * G Street Pub used to have a great "pub grub" menu that was made all the better by having half-priced apps from 3PM-7PM everyday. Now the menu has been upscaled to Enzo's fancy tastes. Bring back the Buffalo Wings and fries. Artichoke spinach dip just doesn't mix well with PBR on tap... -["TonyMagagna"]
    * There is definitely a lack of good happy hour food specials in town.  Right now the best thing going is Little Prague, oddly enough.  The $2 sausage or the $6 sampler are both awesome, but it feels a little too elegant for my simple pub-food tastes.  -["JaimeRaba" jr]

== Hookah Bar ==
 * It is a matter of necessity. Davis needs a hookah bar. -["MikeKayton"]
 * It seems like a "surprising" amount of people have their own hookahs.  Actually, I don't know if they still do, but ["Sam's Mediteranean"] used to have several ornate hookahs on display.  I was talking to Sam's daughter, and she said they were talking about having a hookah setup-- but since Davis has so many anti-smoking ordinances, I bet they discovered it would basically be illegal to operate -["JaimeRaba" jr]
 * A large number of people in town have hookahs, myself included. Seems like this crowd would have access to one? Hookah/Movie nights were pretty popular with my friends. - ["KenNeville"]
Hooka Bars can't be established in Davis because of a city ordinance that prohibits smoking within and around 100 feet of any establishment. - ["RobertBaron"]
 * Davis definatly needs a hookah bar. We finally got ["Dead Zone Novelties"], the cool novelty store that sells smoking supplies, now we just need a chill place to enjoy them. It sucks that the nearest hookah bar is in sac, and we have to drive a half hour away to enjoy some good sheesha. City council needs to recognize that this is primarily a college town, and without us students, there would be no davis. --["CCTush"]
== 24-Hour Los Angeles-Style Mexican Restaurant ==
 * LA-style restaurants do not use excessive "filling" (e.g., lettuce, beans, rice) in their burritos.  Take for example the famous [http://www.albertosmexicanfoods.com/menu.htm Alberto's] mom-and-pop chain (each store individually owned).  Their Carne Asada burrito is a model for all Taco Shop aspirants to follow.  AND they're 24-hour.  Where's the 24-hour authentic mexican food?  - ["JaimeRaba"]
    * I don't think of 24-hour restaurants when I think authentic mexican food.  And I didn't know they had a 24 hour fitness around here... - ["MarieHuynh"]
      * "Mom & Pop" mexican fast-food joints in ["SoCal"] are often open 24-hours. - ["JeyKottalam"]
            *I'm thinking of the incredibly popular Freebirds near UC Santa Barbara. - ["JamesDawe"]
            *Yeah, but Freebirds is mainly popular because it is always open, not so much because it is always good. Sometime about 1996 or so their quality took a nosedive. Odd fact about Freebirds: For a while (1998 or so I think) they were having a lot of trouble with drunk roudy frat guys late at night. As a result, they were looking at hiring a bouncer. That would make it the only burrito joint I've ever heard of with a bouncer. - ["EricKlein"]
      * Yeah, totally.  And the 24-hour fitness is basically next to Sudwerk, although on 2nd Street. - ["JaimeRaba"]
    * I hate all the filler in my burritos, like rice.  Rice doesn't belong in there to me, but when you get it without rice, it's all empty.  I need to get some of those LA burritos. - ["RohiniJasavala"]
      * I have seen the "California burrito" be the special of the day at ["El Mariachi"].  I believe it is filled with fries and sour cream? - ["MikeIvanov"]
         *Wow, that's something different.  I guess it is like a potatoey burrito.  Taco Bell added potatoes to their burritos to make them more "filling". - ["RohiniJasavala"]
== Authentic Italian Food ==
 * Authentic Italian Food - While Davis lacks restaurants in a general capacity, there seems to be a complete lack of '''good''' Italian food.  Pizza is not a substitute for a real Italian restaurant. - ["BrandonKeene"]
 * While I think Original Pete's and ["Caffe Italia"] do a decent job, I don't think they're quite up to North Beach standards.  Could Davis support a true Italian restaurant?  I bet it could.

== Dim Sum ==
 * Dim Sum!  There's enough chinese people around aren't there?  Why don't they stop doing Japanese food and start selling some real chinese food?
   * Maybe we need some real asians ;) - ["ScottBiggart"]
* One of the current restaurants needs to try a dim sum menu on weekends. I'd go just to avoid driving to Sac for it. ''Good'' dim sum?  Even better! - ["KevinChin"]
== Coffeehouse ==
 * I want pancakes, bacon and fries at the Coffeehouse. - ["JenndelaVega"]
 * I was thinking that the ["Coffee House" CoHo] needs to expand and just take __over__ ["The Silo"] and sell the same sort of food they sold, but a little better for you. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
   * I'm with Phil on this taking over the silo talk. ASUCD should just take over Sodexho's contracts on campus completely. - ["DanMasiel"]
   * Sodexho is horrible--foodwise, and ethics-wise.  I mean they were the company sued for providing food to prisoners that was so nasty and unhealthy that it allegedly violated prisoners' civil rights.  I think the Coffeehouse should run all food on campus.  They run a surprisingly tight ship, good food, good prices and are extremely responsive to student needs.  Sodexho is a shover robot. - ["JaimeRaba"]


= Shopping = 
== Target ==
Apparently there are some tentative plans for the city to consider allowing a Target by ["24 Hour Fitness"]. See the [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/target/faq.cfm City of Davis Target FAQ].  ["Davis Wish List: Target" Discuss this].
== Trader Joe's ==
 * Trader Joe's would be a nice thing to have.  they have lots of reasonably priced wine, and they have the best prepackaged tomato roasted red pepper soup... yum. - ["LauraCochrane"]
    * Trader Joe's would not be nice in Davis. We have our own local store that sells similar things that Tader Joe's does. It is called ["The Co-Op"]. Why would you want your town be like every other?  - ["RobRoy"]
    * I think the co-op would continue to make Davis unique, even if it had a Trader Joe's.  But then again, lots of other towns have Co-ops.  Take Sacramento's co-op, for example-- it's a bit nicer in many respects, yet the prices are lower and the organic selection is bigger.   I think a little healthy competition would help the co-op out a little bit.  That's been the case in Sacramento.  I think the Davis Co-op is a little set in its ways and in its state of cleanliness.  If you ever read the co-op newsletter, I'm a little confounded with their fairly frequent dismissals of very good ideas and recommendations.  But I re-main pro-co-op.  I'm just not anti-Trader Joe's.  I think a good spot for a TJ's would be out around Mace/Chiles. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
   * Sorry, but I personally really want Trader Joe's here. They have stuff that you just can't get at the Co-Op--for example, "Two-buck Chuck." Not to mention their wonderful assortments of import foods, etc. Trader Joe's would add so much to this town. - ["DougBarbieri" rdb]
   * I agree with ["JaimeRaba"], a little competition should be good for the Co-Op.  And if this town can support two Nuggets within three miles of eachother, it can support a TJ and Co-op. - ["KrisFricke"]
   * I third that one. I think the abandoned Ralph's on East 8th St would be a perfect TJ's spot, and ''nothing'' beats peanut-butter-filled pretzels. - ["KenNeville"]
   * I recall reading that there are actual plans to build a TJs at 8th and Pole Line. I for one welcome this - they carry many kinds of kosher food that I can't get at the co-op. I just wish they would have opened it already, so it will be open before I graduate -- ["KenBloom"]
   * A Trader Joe's would be nice, but I just don't think it would be economically feasible at this time.  Since I've moved here two grocery stores, Ralph's and the place in the U-mall, have gone under. Neither was that great, but were in pretty good locations. -- ["ToNu"]
     * The Harvest Market (formerly in the U-Mall, and before that in the Russell Rite Aid building) did not go under.  They were doing extremely well according to one of the owners.  However, CostPlus made an offer they couldn't refuse.  Essentially they were purchased out of existance, and the family running Harvest Market got to retire in style.  Oh well, at least some good came out of it.  The Ralphs went out of business because they too closely duplicated grocery stores that were in a better location for most of Davis.  A Trader Joe's, however, would not be duplicating anything.  However, Trader Joe's has scoffed at locating there.  They feel it is not a high enough traffic area.  But they dont realize is this:  build it, and they will come.  -["JaimeRaba" jr]
  * I think the Food Co-op is quite anti Trader Joe's... and probably for a good reason.  I think a Trader Joe's would greatly hurt the horribly inefficient Co-op's business.  But perhaps the Co-op would step up to the challenge and actually improve.  I guess either way would be good for us.  - ["JevanGray"]

==Plus Size Women's Clothing Store==
  * Of course we know that everybody in Davis is physically fit, but on the off chance that there might be someone larger than a size 3 wandering around the streets, it's too bad that they have to drive in to Woodland or to Sacramento to find clothes. 
     * Although, ANY clothing would help.  Okay, now Davis has a few more "fashion botiques."  But aside from Gottschalks and the Gap, there's nowhere for guys really to shop at all.  Davis has a zillion trinket stores and "chinese" restaurants.  It even has an automall.
   * ["Samira's"] is one of the few places in town that I know of that carries non-tiny (women's) clothing sizes.  - ["JevanGray"]

==Men's Clothing Store==
  * Even I, a girl, have noticed the lack of guys' clothing options here in Davis.  Let's have at least one male-themed clothes store. - ["TerryCliff"]
  * James Anthony and the Gap both sell men's clothing. - ["JackHaskel"]
  * This is seriously a consideralbe problem for all of Davis-- men in this town are in serious trouble when it comes to clothing! While The Savvy Shoppe has offered a small step forward with their singular rack of Paper Denims and t-shirts for guys, there is a ridiculously disproportionate number of Riki-esque 30+ women's boutiques. - ["GrahamKolbeins"]

= Coffee late at night =
 * I know this is a pipe dream, but I'd love to have a place in Davis where I could get coffee at practically any hour (that isn't AMPM).  It was so nice when ["Cafe Roma"] stayed open for 24 during that one finals week -- oh, such a taste of what was possible!  I hear that it isn't worth it to keep a coffee shop open that late at night, and it's likely not, but it'd still be cool to have a place to get coffee. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
  * Ahh, such a sweet, sad dream. Coffee at night. It's pathetic that a college town of this size can't support an all night coffee shop. When I'm up at 4 am and need coffee and a quiet place to study, I have to go to Dixon, which can be a real pain when I only have my bike available. How can Davis have 25K students, and not enough late nighters to make it worthwhile? What is wrong with everyone? Ok, I think I'm done ranting, but I too dream of a 24-hour Roma. - ["EricKlein"]
  * I would waaaay make use of an all night cafe (especially one with free wireless Internet). - ["DougBarbieri"]
  * Let's just start our own student-run 24-hour coffee shop. Most likely stupid & not feasible, but can't hurt to look at the costs. - ["JeyKottalam"]


= Real Asian supermarket =
 * Davis needs a real Asian food store, like the ones you find on Stockton Blvd in Sac. If there are enough Asians here to support the Old Teahouse, there's enough to support such a store.  Cheap fresh seafood, cheap shitake mushrooms, chili sauces...drool...speaking of which, Davis also needs a gay dance club because you can't dance in coffee shops - ["GaryMa"]
    * Gary, have you been to that Korean place next to ["Silver Dragon"]? - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
    * Yeah, but that place's selection is actually inferior to the former Harvest Market.  And the prices are EXTREMELY high.  The Asian markets on Stockton Blvd and also Broadway are BIG stores that are full service.  I'd be all for a true Asian super-market.  There used to be a Ralph's near 8th and L streets, and it's a supermarket that is _completely_ empty.  This would be perfect for an Asian store. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]

= Road issues =
 * I think there needs to be a better stop sign at the intersection of Marina Circle and Jerome St. in ["West Davis"].  No one who doesn't live there can see it due to the high turn radius and the trees in the way.  I may go to a city council meeting to tell someone about this because every single one of my friends runs the stop sign the first time they drive through there and somebody might get hurt. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
 * Davis is renewing threats to give tickets to people who park "parking space style" at the end of cul de sacs, rather than parallel parking.  Most of the houses at the end of cul de sacs have little to no nearby street parking.  They should let us park this way,since it's been done this way for at least 40 years, but i think the trash collectors are complaing because they can't get their trucks close enough to the cans.  Poor things. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
 * There needs to be MORE THAN ONE STREET SIGN PER INTERSECTION.  (Yes, I know, there are usually two.  Regardless, they're inadequate.)  Too small, set too far back from the street, totally useless at night when moving with any speed. ["ChrisTakemura" ct]
 * A parking district around Cuarto. The school decided that freshmen can't bring cars to campus. Guess what - they still do bring cars, and they keep them permenantly parked in the public parking spaces at Oxford Circle park and on all of the nearby streets. (All this while the campus owned parking lots for the dorms are practically empty because nobody can get a permit to park there). A 3-hour parking district would help greatly so that my friends could drive over and visit me. ["KenBloom"]
*Parking downtown is a nightmare, especially if you are a resident. Parking from C street up to A street should be resident parking only, and if the city wants to keep parking regualtion, then it should only be one hour parking so that people dont come and park for their two hour classes and take the spots that the residents who live in the area need. --["CCTush"]

= Entertainment =

==Independent Movie Theatre==
 *I think an art house like the ["Crest Theater"] or ["Tower Theater"] would really improve life in Davis. There’s no reason residents of a fairly liberal college town should have to drive 20 minutes to see an independent film. (I don’t count the one or two showings of vaguely indie films they have at the ["Movie Theaters" Regal Theatres].) - ["AmeliaCarlson"]
   * I think the absence of such a place is the reason why the ["Alternative Film Club"] was so popular.  Somebody start this club back up! - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
   * Tower Theater is owned by a New York company that is purely profit oriented.  I pitched showing Rocky Horror there (I'm the director of the local cast) and they nixed it.  Crest is local - support them.  Campus Cinema tried showing art and cult films (both obscure and well publicized ones like Kensey) and averaged about six people per show.  Meanwhile, Taxi and Alfie pull in a packed theater.  Indie theater is dying for a reason - people don't go (and yes, I'd like one too).  - ["JabberWokky"]

== An All Ages Venue ==
 * There are many all ages venues in Davis. Every house in this town has the capability of putting on a ["House Show"] but there are no official all ages venues in this town. The ["Coffee House"] has shows but it is not consistent. This town needs to do something about how half of its population ie. Students don't have any real place where they can appreciate music that fits their needs. -["RobRoy"]
   * I read something about the old Theater being taken over by new management and so forth, but that the City Council had wanted to pass a resolution prohibiting it from being used exclusively as a (["Hip-hop scene" Hip-hop?]) venue.  My net is too slow, otherwise I'd check into this. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
