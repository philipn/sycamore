This piece is not as public as other ["Campus Art"] pieces because it's not an outdoor fixture. The horse sculpture is located in the Walter A. ["Buehler Alumni & Visitors Center"] Lobby. It was made by ["UC Davis"] alumn Deborah Butterfield.

Butterfield commented on the piece: "I wanted to create a piece that would humanize the space, that would give it a scale that was more recognizable, a more intimate feeling. The building needed a piece that was larger than life."
