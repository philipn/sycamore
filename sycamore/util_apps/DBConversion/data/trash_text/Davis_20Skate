Currently consisting of only a few dedicated skaters, Davis Skate is a weekly tradition which dates back several years, when it was quite a bit more popular.  The group meets '''every Wednesday at 7:00 PM at the ["Farmers Market"] on 4th and C Streets''' and the skate begins at 7:10, following one of several regular routes through various neighborhoods, ["Bike Paths" bike paths], and ["Parks" parks] of Davis.  The pace depends on the level of experience of the group, and any level skater is encouraged to join.  The routes allow for several rest and water stops.  Safety gear is recommended.

Davis Skate has a [http://davisskate.tripod.com/ website] with information on times and routes.
