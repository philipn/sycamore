Manny sings in the anonymous crowd. 

At his wedding they will play "The Press Gang" when they walk down the aisle. 

His favorite singer is Eddie Murphey. 

He's Jewish and tries to stay Kosher, although I made him eat the Pastor from Guadalajara, cuz frankly, it's worth going to hell for (or wherever evil jews go).

He likes to watch "Legend" with Tom Cruise on mute with Children of Bodom playing in the background while he smokes from a bong made out of a dragon horn. 

Pretty decent guy if you ask me.
