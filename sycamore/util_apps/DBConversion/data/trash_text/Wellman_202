Wellman 2 is a moderately sized lecture hall in the basement of ["Wellman Hall"]. Like most classrooms on the UCD campus, Wellman 2 is equipped with a DVD player and LCD projector, and because Wellman is often left unlocked, this makes Wellman a prime renegade ["Movies" movie] theater. Grab a DVD, some friends [[s(begin)]]and some beers[[s(end)]] and head over to Wellman. 

Especially important for renegadge ["Movies" movies]: If Wellman is locked and you need to get in, waiting outside of ["Kerr Hall" Kerr] for a few minutes for a graduate student to go inside will allow you into ["Kerr Hall" Kerr].  Once you're in Kerr, you can always get into ["Wellman Hall" Wellman] by going down the stairs to the lowest level and following that little tunnel.  It leads right to ["Wellman Hall" Wellman].
