== Lists and Indenting ==
Create bulleted and numbered lists is easy and intuitive. All you do is inserting the line containing the list item. To get bulleted items, start the item with '''space and an asterisk''' "{{{ *}}}"; to get numbered items, start it with a '''space and a number template''' "{{{ 1.}}}", "{{{ a.}}}", "{{{ A.}}}", "{{{ i.}}}" or "{{{ I.}}}". Anything else will just indent the line. To start a numbered list with a certain initial value, append "{{{#}}}''value''" to the number template.

To nest lists of different levels, you use different depths of indenting. All items on the same indent level belong to the same (sub-)list. That also means that you cannot change the style of a list after you started it.

Definition lists can be created by items of the form {{{<whitespace>term:: definition}}}; note that the ''term'' cannot currently contain any wiki markup.

For more information on the possible markup, see ["Help/Help On Editing" Help on Editing].

=== Example ===
{{{
If you indent text
  like this, then it is indented in the output
    you can have multiple levels of indent

And if you put asterisks at the start of the line
  * you get a
  * bulleted
  * list
    * which can also be indented
      * to several levels

A numbered list, mixed with bullets:
  1. one
  1. two
    1. one
      * bullet 1
      * bullet 2
    1. two
  1. three
    * bullet
      1. one

Variations of numbered lists:
  * Lowercase roman
    i. one
    i. two
  * Uppercase roman (with start offset 42)
    I.#42 forty-two
    I. forty-three
  * Lowercase alpha
    a. one
    a. two
  * Uppercase alpha
    A. one
    A. two

 term:: definition
 another term:: and its definition

It's not possible to have a bullet inside of a table unless you type the code {{{&#149;}}}
